# Personal NixOS Configurations
This is the flake.nix and list of configurations that run all of the machines on my personal home network.

Currently I have 5 machines, my workstation, a personal laptop, a macOS virtual machine host, a Raspberry Pi4, and an old Dell R710 server that I have yet to officially setup. All machines are currently named after the angels from Neon Genesis Evangelion.

Currently I use nixos-anywhere to deploy machines (where possible), and deploy-rs for deploying updates.
